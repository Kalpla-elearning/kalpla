# ⚡ Quick Fix: AWS IAM Permissions

## 🔍 **Current Status:**
- ✅ S3 Access: Working
- ❌ SSM Access: Missing (required for Amplify)
- ❌ CloudFormation Access: Missing (required for Amplify)
- ❌ IAM Access: Missing (required for Amplify)

## 🚀 **Quick Solution (2 Options):**

### **Option 1: Add Required Policies to Existing User (5 minutes)**

1. **Go to AWS IAM Console:**
   - Open: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/
   - Click "Users" → "kalpla-course"

2. **Add These Policies:**
   - Click "Add permissions" → "Attach policies directly"
   - Search and attach:
     - `AmazonSSMReadOnlyAccess`
     - `AWSCloudFormationFullAccess`
     - `IAMFullAccess`

3. **Test:**
   ```bash
   node test-aws-permissions.js
   npx ampx sandbox
   ```

### **Option 2: Create New Admin User (3 minutes)**

1. **Create New User:**
   - Go to IAM → Users → Create user
   - Username: `amplify-admin`
   - Attach policy: `AdministratorAccess`

2. **Get Access Keys:**
   - Click "Security credentials" tab
   - Create access key
   - Download CSV file

3. **Update AWS Credentials:**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # Enter new access key and secret
   ```

4. **Test:**
   ```bash
   node test-aws-permissions.js
   npx ampx sandbox
   ```

## 🎯 **Recommended: Option 2 (Admin User)**

This is faster and guarantees all permissions work:

1. **Create admin user with `AdministratorAccess`**
2. **Update credentials with `aws configure`**
3. **Test with `node test-aws-permissions.js`**
4. **Run `npx ampx sandbox`**

## ✅ **Expected Result:**

After fixing permissions, you should see:
```
✅ All tests passed! AWS permissions are correctly configured.
✅ Sandbox environment created successfully
```

## 🆘 **If You Don't Have Admin Access:**

Ask your AWS account administrator to:
1. Add the required policies to `kalpla-course` user
2. Or create a new user with `AdministratorAccess` for you

**The issue is clear: missing SSM, CloudFormation, and IAM permissions. Fix this and Amplify will work!** 🎉
